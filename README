# Getting Started
once in the directory, run 'bundle install'

## Server
Using thin server because webbrick messes up with omniauth
    sudo gem install thin

## Building database
- Make sure schema is updated (all migrations are done), and then execute rake db:seed to seed the database with spring 2011 course data
- Alternately, you can just run rake db:setup to setup the entire database (and make sure migrated to latest version of schema)

## Running
    thin start
or
    screen thin start
(ctrl+a, d) to get out of the screen. (screen -r to resume)
