Building database
- Make sure schema is updated (all migrations are done), and then execute rake db:seed to seed the database with spring 2011 course data
- Alternately, you can just run rake db:setup to setup the entire database (and make sure migrated to latest version of schema)

Viewing courses
- http://localhost:3000/courses
